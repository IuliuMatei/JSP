This is my first Webb Application. With uses Java Server Pages and a Java Bean.

This project was made for TV Companies to manage their employees, TV channels and the subscriptions easyly. Other than Java, HTML and CSS, this project also uses a data base with the help of MySql.
There, I made 2 tables, clients and tvchannels that are connected with a relation M:N using a third table, subscription using foreign keys.

In this app, you can view, add modify and delete clients/channels/subscriptions.

Hope you like it. ðŸ˜Š
